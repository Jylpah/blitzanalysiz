Hy! 

[BlitzAnalysiz.com](/) is a site about in-depth game statistics of 
[Wargaming's](https://wargaming.com) [World of Tanks Blitz](https://wotblitz.eu/). 
You won't find individial player statistics here - for those, please check awesome 
[Blitzstars.com](https://blitzstars.com). Instead, the the site is about analysis 
of the player population and tank performance statistics. <!--more-->

The statistics shown at the site are based on maybe the largest collection of Blitz 
player stats outside Wargaming's servers containing over 100 million individual tank 
statistics from more than 600,000 players from EU, RU, Asia and North American servers. 

BlitzAnalysiz[] is build by [Jylpah@EU](https://www.blitzstars.com/player/eu/Jylpah). 
You can reach out me via email ([Jylpah@gmail.com](mailto:jylpah@gmail.com)), Discord (Jylpah#4662). 
I am also active at [WoT Blitz EU forums](http://forum.wotblitz.eu/index.php?/forum/19-gameplay/).
