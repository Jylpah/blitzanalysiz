BlitzAnalysiz[] is a site about in-depth game statistics of [Wargaming's](https://wargaming.com) 
[World of Tanks Blitz](https://wotblitz.eu/) World war II-themed multiplayer online tank game. 
You won't find individial player statistics here - for those, please check awesome 
[Blitzstars.com](https://blitzstars.com). Instead, the the site is about analysis of the 
overall player population and tank performance statistics. 

All the data has been fetched via WG's [API](https://developers.wargaming.net/) 
using [blitz-stats](https://github.com/Jylpah/blitz-stats) Python tool. 
and processed in [R](https://rstudio.com/). The web site has been build with [Knitr](https://yihui.org/knitr/) 
and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

Big thanks for [BlitzStars.com](https://blitzstars.com)'s developer SockRobber 
and [WotInspector.com](https://wotinspector.com)'s developer reven86 for all the support!
