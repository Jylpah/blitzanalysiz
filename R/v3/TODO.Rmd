```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, dev = 'svglite', fig.ext = 'svgz');
```

This is a non-comprehensive list of things I plan to work on when I have time. 


* **[Stratified sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratified_sampling)** for Relative 
WR analysis to further eliminate the impact of different player populations to measure.

* Analysis of **historical data** from early releases. For veteran tank nerds only.  

* **Interactive charts**. The site is based on 100% static content: HTML & JavaScript 
files and PNG images. I need to investigate if I could use Javascript-based interactive 
chart-library such as [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) at the site. This will be a _major_ overhaul.
